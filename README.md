# GENEVA - A CODEC EXPERIMENT

I originally wanted to build a security communications device that helps you chat with someone in a safe zone in real time. Using Technologies like WebRTC and Socket.IO, I was able to create a real time P2P video conference between two peers simultaneously.

Geneva also generates location coordinates of each participant via the IP or Wi-Fi associated with each devices position.

This experiment represents the beginning steps of a greater project. For now, feel free to chat with your friends seamlessly using the flow of WebRTC.
